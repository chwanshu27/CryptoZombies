# CryptoZombies
An Ethereum-blockchain based decentralized gaming application. 

**Description:**
</br>
Build your own zombie army and simulate fights between your army and your friend's army. Also, in the meantime keep improving your zombies' abilites by feeding them on cryptoKitties (Yes! Zombies feed on cryptoKitties;p) and prepare them for battles. 
Several features such as transferring zombies to your friends' armies, levelling up your zombies by spending tokens, attacking on other zombies etc. are also available. 
So, gear up for the ultimate battles of zombies. May the strongest zombie win.B)

**Languages:** Solidity, JavaScript, JSON, html

**Tools used for development:-**
</br>
*Truffle framework:* For boilerplate codes and structure.
*Web3.js:* A JavaScript library which acts as an interface for interacting with the Ethereum node.
*Web3 Provider: MetaMask* (A browser extension which makes a brower compatible for interacting with websites that are using Web3.js. It uses under the hood *Infura* as a web3 provider.)

**For testing:**
</br>
*Ganache:* A local testing blockchain network consisting of 10 nodes.

This project uses *^0.5.0* version of the Solidity.

**Ps:** This repository is still under work. However, the back-end part is fully functional and can be compiled/run on terminal successfully.
